Chapter 1 Question 3
"URLify"
PROMPT:
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,
and that you are given the 'true' length of the string
(Note: if implementing in java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)
