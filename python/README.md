# Python 3

My solutions, written in Python 3, for the Cracking the Coding Interview problems

--------------------------

## Run Tests

Utilizing unittest, I have written test cases for all of the problems. The testing may not be robust in most cases.
Run the tests for all problems using the following replacing "[Repo Directory]" with the directory of your cloned repository:

`python3 -m unittest discover -s [Repo Directory]/CrackingCoding/python -p "p*.py" -v`

"-v" is used for verbosity to show the list of tests ran.
