 Chapter 1 Question 3
 "URLify"
 PROMPT:
 Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
 You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,
 and that you are given the 'true' length of the string
 (Note: if implementing in java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place)
